# Todo-List


# How to use the app

This app allows the user to create a Todo list, mark when the item is completed, and then delete the marked item. 
To run the app, you need either an emulator or an android device you an then connect to android studio.
Once you've started your emulator or device, the app should start up after you tell android studio to run the program.
Once the program is running, click on the edit text box with the item you'd like to enter. After typing your item, click on the enter item button.
When the item is complete, mark the check box the right hand side of the item. After the item is checked, click delete item.

# Purpose
